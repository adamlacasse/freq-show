# üé∂ FreqShow Project Notes

## 1. Project Overview

**FreqShow** is a web application designed as an **encyclopedic music information explorer** for serious music enthusiasts‚Äîespecially Gen X listeners and collectors‚Äîwho enjoy reading about artists, albums, genres, and reviews.  

The idea was inspired by **AllMusic.com**, but FreqShow aims to be:
- Faster and cleaner (less ad clutter)
- Open and customizable
- Built for discovery and critical appreciation, not social or user-generated noise

In short:
> A music metadata and review explorer for nerds who still read liner notes.

---

## 2. Design Goals and Philosophy

### üéØ Target Audience
- Music obsessives and collectors with broad tastes (rock, jazz, R&B, punk, electronic, etc.)
- Users who value *critical* reviews and factual data (not crowdsourced chatter)
- Often from Gen X or older millennial cohorts‚Äîpeople who remember CDs, vinyl, and music journalism.

### üß≠ Guiding Principles
1. **‚ÄúResearch-first‚Äù experience:** FreqShow should feel like a hybrid between an encyclopedia and a record store conversation.
2. **No ads or algorithmic junk:** Prioritize performance, readability, and depth.
3. **Critically curated:** Prefer professional or aggregated critical reviews to user reviews.
4. **Modular & hackable:** The app should be friendly to developers who might want to extend it (via APIs or plugins).
5. **Fun and whimsical, not pretentious:** Self-aware music nerdery with personality.

### üß¢ Name Origin
**FreqShow** plays on the dual meanings of:
- ‚ÄúFreq‚Äù = audio frequency (technical/musical angle)
- ‚ÄúFreak show‚Äù = tongue-in-cheek nod to music obsessives

Example taglines:
- *FreqShow ‚Äî for those who still read liner notes.*
- *FreqShow ‚Äî deep cuts, no ads.*
- *FreqShow ‚Äî a database for the musically obsessed.*

## 3. Backend Plan (Go)

### üí° Language Choice
Backend implemented in **Go (Golang)** for its performance, simplicity, and native concurrency.
Go is a strong fit for:
- API servers
- Concurrent web scraping or data aggregation tasks
- Static typing and easy deployment

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Responsibilities
- **Data aggregation layer:** Pull metadata and reviews from various APIs and public data sources.
- **Normalization:** Standardize artist, album, and genre data structures.
- **Storage:** Cache results in a local database (likely SQLite or Postgres).
- **REST or GraphQL API:** Serve structured data to the Angular frontend.

### üß© Modules / Packages
1. `freqshow/api` ‚Äî REST handlers (artist, album, review endpoints)
2. `freqshow/data` ‚Äî models and schema definitions
3. `freqshow/sources` ‚Äî adapters for external APIs (MusicBrainz, Discogs, etc.)
4. `freqshow/review` ‚Äî stores critical reviews (parsed or summarized)
5. `freqshow/db` ‚Äî handles database connections, migrations, and caching

### üîå Potential Data Sources & APIs
| Source | Use | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **MusicBrainz API** | Artist, album, release metadata | Free, structured, reliable |
| **Discogs API** | Album details, credits, catalog numbers | Requires API key, generous limits |
| **Last.fm API** | Tags, genres, basic descriptions | Good for supplemental genre data |
| **Wikipedia / Wikidata** | Context and bios | Can use for fallback info |
| **RateYourMusic (RYM)** | Ratings, reviews | No public API ‚Äî scraping risk; avoid for now |
| **AllMusic (informational)** | Review source | No API; possible future scraping or licensed use |

> Goal: combine structured data (MusicBrainz/Discogs) with curated review text from reliable sources (public domain or licensed).

## 4. Frontend Plan (Angular)

### üß† Motivation
The developer (you) is experienced in React but switching to **Angular** professionally, so this project will double as a hands-on learning experience.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- **Angular 17+**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for clean, consistent styling
- **RxJS** for handling asynchronous API calls
- **Routing** for different views (Artists, Albums, Genres, Reviews)
- Optional: **NgRx** for state management once the app grows

### üß© Core Components
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `ArtistList` | Displays artists by search or alphabetical index |
| `ArtistDetail` | Bio, discography, related artists |
| `AlbumDetail` | Tracklist, credits, reviews |
| `ReviewCard` | Displays critic review excerpts |
| `GenreExplorer` | Overview of genres and subgenres |
| `SearchBar` | Global search and quick lookup |
| `FreqShowHeader` / `Footer` | Branding and navigation |
| `AboutPage` | Project info, mission statement |

### üñãÔ∏è Visual Style
- Minimalist but warm; evoke a record-store feel
- Subtle animation and polish using Framer Motion‚Äìstyle equivalents for Angular
- Whimsical ‚Äúfreq show‚Äù flair ‚Äî maybe waveform dividers or vinyl-inspired UI touches

// Simplified Go data model examples

type Artist struct {
    ID          string
    Name        string
    Biography   string
    Genres      []string
    Albums      []Album
    Related     []string // artist IDs
    ImageURL    string
}

type Album struct {
    ID          string
    Title       string
    ArtistID    string
    Year        int
    Genre       string
    Label       string
    Tracks      []Track
    Review      Review
    CoverURL    string
}

type Review struct {
    Source      string
    Author      string
    Rating      float64
    Summary     string
    Text        string
    URL         string
}
```

## 6. Immediate Next Steps (MVP Roadmap)

### Phase 1: Data & API foundation
- [ ] Create Go project structure (`cmd/server`, `pkg/api`, `pkg/data`, etc.)
- [ ] Integrate MusicBrainz API for basic artist and album data
- [ ] Store fetched results locally (SQLite/Postgres)
- [ ] Expose REST endpoints:
  - `/artists/:id`
  - `/albums/:id`
  - `/search?q=`
- [ ] Add logging, error handling, and rate limiting

### Phase 2: Angular client prototype
- [ ] Bootstrap Angular app (`ng new freqshow`)
- [ ] Create Artist and Album detail components
- [ ] Connect to backend REST API
- [ ] Implement search and display basic metadata
- [ ] Use Tailwind for styling

### Phase 3: Enrichment & Reviews
- [ ] Experiment with combining review data from open sources
- [ ] Add support for displaying multiple critical voices (where available)
- [ ] Implement caching and pagination

### Phase 4: UX & Personality
- [ ] Branding: logo, color palette, typography
- [ ] Easter eggs / ‚Äúdeep cuts‚Äù mode for power users
- [ ] Optional AI-generated summaries (trained on critic-style prose)

## 7. Long-Term Vision

- A self-hostable, ad-free music encyclopedia for collectors
- Possibly integrate with user‚Äôs local music library (via file metadata)
- Optional offline mode (cached data)
- Potential future companion mobile app

---

## 8. Notes on AI and Metadata Ethics
- Respect copyright and API terms of service
- Prioritize open data sources (MusicBrainz, Wikidata)
- Avoid scraping or republishing proprietary reviews without permission
- Consider using AI to **summarize** existing reviews, not reproduce them verbatim

---

## 9. Summary

**FreqShow** = *music discovery for those who read reviews and credits, not comments.*  
A playful, respectful, developer-built revival of the encyclopedic music culture once embodied by AllMusic.
